# Kreig's Notes

This is a running commentary. Not really parseable.

# Notes

- `let mut` is very interesting to see. mutability as an option but not a default.
- references e.g. `&` sounds like it might be a bit like the pointer functionality in c?
- also interesting to see method chaining operating here
- interesting again to note that the {} is iteratively populated after the text through variable refs. a little different than js text literals and arguably cleaner.
- `Cargo.lock` === `package-lock.json` || `yarn.lock`
- oh and of course `Cargo.toml` === `package.json`
- I can see these are battle-tested docs... no sooner did i wonder "how can i get an api reference" then i come across the `cargo doc` portion.
- `match` reminds me of `switch case`
- `parse` is like `parseInt`
- `_` as a catch-all... analogous to `*`?

One thing I figured out is that I've been monolingual for so long I've forgotten how thinking in another language's paradigms can increase your literacy in general

Also `cargo fmt` makes life better
